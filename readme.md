# Book Note taking app 

A personal project to take notes from books i've read. Including recording if they are finished or not,organising by genre, adding vocabulary if new is found.  Made using node/express. 

## Thing to fix ##

- attach user model to book model. User should have relationship to books

- Error message if non gif,png,jpg uploaded? currently pdf etc not uploaded as 
desired but error message needed?

- check through code/tidy code.

- add read /unread field to book model(done)

- add conditional for edit author,genre, based on req.user

- get random record of books for index page  (aggregate.sample)  ie aggregate.sample(3); (DONE)




## Big things ##

-  add css/ remove bootstrap

-  add js/jquery
