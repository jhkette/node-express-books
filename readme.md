# Book Note taking app 


## Thing to fix ##

- attach user model to book model. User should have relationship to books

- Error message if non gif,png,jpg uploaded? currently pdf etc not uploaded as 
desired but error message needed?

- check through code/tidy code.

- add read /unread field to book model

- add conditional for edit author,genre, based on req.user

- get random record of books for index page  (aggregate.sample)  ie aggregate.sample(3);




## Big things ##

-  add css/ remove bootstrap

-  add js/jquery
